In this github repo, I use python 3.7.* and Java 8 to build different type of data data Structure  and algorithms, feel free to ask me, add new issue and fork 😀.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Python 🐍
#### Prerequisites

+ Python >= 3.7.
+ pip3

#### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

1. clone the repo to your local machine using

``` repo
    $ git clone https://github.com/SalAlba/dataStructure-and-algorithms.git
    $ cd dataStructure-and-algorithms
```

2. create virtual env and run using

``` bash
    $ virtualenv  venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
```

3. install all requirements using

``` bash
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Java ☕ 

TODO ...

## Topics


### Algorithm complexity
Algorithmic complexity (code complexity) it is how  particular algorithm performs, fast or slow. the complexity is defined as numeric function T(n). want to measure the time taken by the algorithm without dive into the implementation [[src]](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamchik/15-121/lectures/Algorithmic%20Complexity/complexity.html)

In Algorithmic Complexity we take care of this three measurement. Big-O, Sigma, Theta. [[1.1.]](#Resources)
1. Big-O (Worst case) - Use an input that gives the slowest performance.
2. Sigma (Best case) - Use an input that give, the best results.
3. Theta (Average case) - Assumes the input is random.
